# Creating Infrastructure - AWS

## Tutorial

If you are not familiar with the Terraform, you can go over [Terraform Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo) from [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as introduction.

Prerequisites:

1. Install Terraform https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html 
2. From the security credentials on AWS create an access key and store it in the ~/.aws/credentials file with the following format:

```
[dev]
aws_access_key_id = 
aws_secret_access_key = 
regions = us-east-1

[prod]
aws_access_key_id = 
aws_secret_access_key = 
regions = us-east-1
```

**Note:** dev and prod will have same credentials

If you dont't know where to create AWS credentials follow [AWS Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html)

After installing Terraform and creating credentials file it is time to create infrastructure on AWS. 

## Terraform state management

- Navigate into infrastructure/terraform/prerequisites/prod directory
- Open remotestate.tf file and comment terraform block section

![remotestate.tf](images/remotestate.png)
- Run terraform init to initialize directory and if everything is okay you should see the following output

![output 1](images/output1.png)
- After that, you have to run terraform apply where you will see the following output

![output 2](images/output2.png)
- You will be prompted to type yes so that program can continue. It will create an S3 bucket in order to manage remote vs local state and a DynamoDB table that has configuration set to only 1 read and 1 write = only one person can manage remote state at a time

- Once apply finishes, remove commented terraform block, initialize terraform with terraform init. You will be prompted with the following message

![output 4](images/output4.png)

Type no since we don't have any state yet.

![output 5](images/output5.png)

Now you are ready to manage infrastructure with the remote state using Terraform.

## Creating EC2 Instance

After setting up Terraform state it is time to create infrastructure for seqr.

- Navigate infrastructure/terraform/environments/prod
- Run terraform init to get new state
- Run terraform apply to apply changes to the AWS where EC2 instance with the configuration that is defined in the seqr.resoruce.tf file = EC2 Instance (m5.2xlarge), root volume with 1TB (change if you need more), security groups for allowing access from the outside of AWS and a public IP address to the instance
- After apply gets to the prompt it should show only 3 resources that are going to be created

As before, type yes and wait until resources are provisioned on AWS.
